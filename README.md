# Overview

This is a basic number guessing game written in Java. A random number between 1 and 100 will be generated, and the user has unlimited attempts to guess it correctly. As guesses are entered, the algorithm will tell the player if the guess was too high or too low. When the correct number is guessed, the program will display the number of guesses it took for the player to get it right.


This is the first application I have written in Java, so my purpose was to further my understanding of this language. In this project, I have implemented variables, functions, classes, conditionals, expressions, and more. Ultimately, my goal was to expand my skill sets to other programming languages in order to expand my overall abilities in software development.
